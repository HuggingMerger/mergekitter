# ChipAlign merge example
merge_method: nuslerp

models:
  - model: ./Gemma-3-27b-pt  # Path to instruction-aligned model (Any type works, experiment away.)
  - model: ./Lambent_Mira-v1.14-27B # Path to chip-specific model

parameters:
  geodesic: true
  lambda: 0.7  # Interpolation factor between the two models (0.0 = instruction model, 1.0 = chip model)
  nuslerp_flatten: true  # Treat tensors as flattened vectors for geodesic interpolation
  
tokenizer:
  source: union # Combine vocabularies from both models

dtype: bfloat16 # Output precision
